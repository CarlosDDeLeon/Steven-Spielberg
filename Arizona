    <p>The next movie for the 2022 year will be about his childhood in Phoenix, Arizona. 
        This movie will center on a young child and teen living in Phoenix during 
        the late 1950s and early '60s and will be covering several time periods. that 
        is the same time Steven Spielberg himself was living in the Valley.</p>

     <p>The character's name is not Steven, even could be a girl. But the story, which Spielberg co-wrote
        with Tony Kushner, sounds like there are definite hints of the young age 
        of Steven.</p><br>
        <p>This movie is set to be released by the year 2022</p>
