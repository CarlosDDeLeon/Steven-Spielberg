    <p>Director, screenwriter, filmmaker and producer Steven Spielberg 
        was born on December 18, 1946, in Cincinnati, Ohio. Spielberg moved 
        several times but everything changed when he spent part of his youth 
        in Phoenix, Arizona.</p>

    <p>While living in Phoenix, when Spielberg was only 13-years-old, decided to 
        film a war film he titled "Escape to Nowhere" using his teenage 
        friends as actors and he won a prize for his 40 minutes war film.
        The win motivated him to continue to make 15 more amateur 8mm films.
        When he was 16-years-old, Spielberg wrote and directed his first independent film, 
        a 140-minute science fiction adventure called Firelight, which would later
        inspire Close Encounters. He made the film with $500 he borrowed from his dad, 
        and was shown in a local cinema for one evening, which 
        earned back its cost. After attending Arcadia High School in Phoenix for 
        three years, his family next moved to Saratoga, California where he later 
        graduated from Saratoga High School in 1965.</p>
